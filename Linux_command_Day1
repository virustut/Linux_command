🔹 What is Swap in Linux?
Swap is disk space used as virtual memory when the system’s physical RAM is full.
It’s like an “overflow” area where inactive memory pages can be moved to free up RAM.

Swap can be a partition or a file (/swapfile).
🔹 Why do we use Swap?

Handle Memory Shortage
If your system runs out of physical RAM, swap prevents applications from crashing by temporarily moving less-used memory pages to disk.

System Stability
Without swap, if RAM fills up completely, Linux may start killing processes (OOM killer).
With swap, the system slows down but remains stable.

Hibernate (Suspend-to-Disk)
When you hibernate a laptop, the full RAM contents are written to swap.
On resume, it’s restored back into memory.
For this, swap must be at least as large as RAM.
Buffer for Spikes
In production servers, workloads often spike. Swap helps absorb sudden short bursts of memory usage.

# create a user in linux
sudo useradd dba1 --->this command will run with the root user or super user

# see user
cat /etc/passwd or search cat /etc/passwd | grep dba1

# command difference
if we use mkdir folder # with a named user who have full rights the folder will create
but 
if use sudo mkdir folder1 # with same user but just su then the folder will create as root user   

# Note : to increase the command screen size press CTRL+SHIFT+plus button

# to start the terminal using command 
press ALT + F2 and type gnome-terminal -> then it will open 

# two types of console
1. physical console ctlr+alt+f3 it is open the new wizard command open up to 6 terminal and press ctrl+alt+f1 rollback and f2 willl
open the graphical user gui

2. virtual console 
[root@localhost ~]# tty
/dev/pts/1


🔹 What is tty?

tty = teletypewriter → the terminal device you’re currently using.

In Linux, every terminal (physical console, SSH session, or pseudo-terminal like in GNOME Terminal) is represented by a device file under /dev/.
# run tty this will know in which mode we have work
for virtual console show pts

/dev/tty1        # physical console (Ctrl+Alt+F1)
/dev/pts/0       # first SSH or GUI terminal session
/dev/pts/2       # another SSH session


🔹 Switch between TTYs in Red Hat

On a physical machine:

Ctrl + Alt + F1 → TTY1

Ctrl + Alt + F2 → TTY2

…

Ctrl + Alt + F6 → TTY6

Ctrl + Alt + F7 → usually graphical interface (GNOME desktop).

On a VM or remote SSH, you only see pseudo-terminals (/dev/pts/X).

# to logout root user type

# to go specific user type

# what is BASH  --> GNU Bourne Again Shell or it is  a shell
The bash is a program that interprets command typed in by the user, called command line interpreter

the default shell of linux os -/bin/bash

bash is the improved version of sh(Bourne Shell)
Regular user start the shell prompt , end with $sign
For the root user (super user) , shell prompt end with #sign

# to find where program execute type
which ls => try to find where is it 

# command to find in which os we work
cat /etc/redhat-release
uname -a 

# the BASH is similar to cmd.exe in windows 

useradd -u 2001 user02

optons : are use to change the behaviour of command
here -u is a option and user02 is an argument 


command , option , argument
